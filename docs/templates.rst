Language overview
==================

- ``{{ ... }}`` for variables to print to the template output
- ``{% ... %}`` for tags
- ``{# ... #}`` for comments not included in the template output

Variables
---------

A variable can be defined in your template using the following:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {{ variable }}

Stencil will look up the variable inside the current variable context and
evaluate it. When a variable contains a dot, it will try doing the
following lookup:

- Context lookup
- Dictionary lookup
- Array lookup (first, last, count, index)
- Key value coding lookup
- Type introspection

For example, if `people` was an array:

.. code-block:: html+django

    There are {{ people.count }} people. {{ people.first }} is the first
    person, followed by {{ people.1 }}.

Filters
~~~~~~~

Filters allow you to transform the values of variables. For example, they look like:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {{ variable|uppercase }}

See :ref:`all builtin filters <built-in-filters>`.

Tags
----

Tags are a mechanism to execute a piece of code, allowing you to have
control flow within your template.

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% if variable %}
      {{ variable }} was found.
    {% endif %}

A tag can also affect the context and define variables as follows:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% for item in items %}
      {{ item }}
    {% endfor %}

Stencil includes of built-in tags which are listed below. You can also
extend Stencil by providing your own tags.

See :ref:`all builtin tags <built-in-tags>`.

Comments
--------

To comment out part of your template, you can use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {# My comment is completely hidden #}

.. _template-inheritance:

Template inheritance
--------------------

Template inheritance allows the common components surrounding individual pages
to be shared across other templates. You can define blocks which can be
overidden in any child template.

Let's take a look at an example. Here is our base template (``base.html``):

.. code-block:: html+django

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>{% block title %}Example{% endblock %}</title>
      </head>

      <body>
        <aside>
          {% block sidebar %}
            <ul>
              <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
              <li><a href="/notes/">Notes</a></li>
            </ul>
          {% endblock %}
        </aside>

        <section>
          {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        </section>
      </body>
    </html>

This example declares three blocks, ``title``, ``sidebar`` and ``content``. We
can use the ``{% extends %}`` template tag to inherit from out base template
and then use ``{% block %}`` to override any blocks from our base template.

A child template might look like the following:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends "base.html" %}

    {% block title %}Notes{% endblock %}

    {% block content %}
      {% for note in notes %}
        <h2>{{ note }}</h2>
      {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}

Since our child template doesn't declare a sidebar block. The original sidebar
from our base template will be used. Depending on the content of ``notes`` our
template might be rendered like the following:

.. code-block:: html

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Notes</title>
      </head>

      <body>
        <aside>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/notes/">Notes</a></li>
          </ul>
        </aside>

        <section>
          <h2>Pick up food</h2>
          <h2>Do laundry</h2>
        </section>
      </body>
    </html>

You can use as many levels of inheritance as needed. One common way of using
inheritance is the following three-level approach:

* Create a ``base.html`` template that holds the main look-and-feel of your site.
* Create a ``base_SECTIONNAME.html`` template for each “section” of your site.
  For example, ``base_news.html``, ``base_news.html``. These templates all
  extend ``base.html`` and include section-specific styles/design.
* Create individual templates for each type of page, such as a news article or
  blog entry. These templates extend the appropriate section template.
