# Stencil Changelog

## Master

### Breaking

_None_

### Enhancements

- Added support for dynamic filter using `filter` filter. With that you can define a variable with a name of filter
, i.e. `myfilter = "uppercase"` and then use it to invoke this filter with `{{ string|filter:myfilter }}`.

## 0.10.1

### Enhancements

- Add support for Xcode 9.1.

## 0.10.0

### Enhancements

- Adds `counter0` to for loop context allowing you to get the current index of
  the for loop 0 indexed.
- Introduces a new `DictionaryLoader` for loading templates from a Swift
  Dictionary.
- Added `in` expression in if tag for strings and arrays of hashable types
- You can now access the amount of items in a dictionary using the `count`
  property.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a potential crash when using the `{% for %}` template tag with the
  incorrect amount of arguments.
- Fixes a potential crash when using incomplete tokens in a template for
  example, `{%%}` or `{{}}`.
- Fixes evaluating nil properties as true


## 0.9.0

### Enhancements

- `for` block now can contain `where` expression to filter array items. For example `{% for item in items where item > 1 %}` is now supported.
- `if` blocks may now contain else if (`elif`) conditions.

  ```html+django
  {% if one or two and not three %}
    one or two but not three
  {% elif four %}
    four
  {% else %}
    not one, two, or four
  {% endif %}
  ```

- `for` block now allows you to iterate over array of tuples or dictionaries.

  ```html+django
  {% for key,value in thing %}
    <li>{{ key }}: {{ value }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
  ```

### Bug Fixes

- You can now use literal filter arguments which contain quotes.
  [#98](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil/pull/98)


## 0.8.0

### Breaking

- It is no longer possible to create `Context` objects. Instead, you can pass a
  dictionary directly to a `Template`s `render` method.

  ```diff
  - try template.render(Context(dictionary: ["name": "Kyle"]))
  + try template.render(["name": "Kyle"])
  ```

- Template loader are no longer passed into a `Context`, instead you will need
  to pass the `Loader` to an `Environment` and create a template from the
  `Environment`.

  ```diff
  let loader = FileSystemLoader(paths: ["templates/"])

  - let template = loader.loadTemplate(name: "index.html")
  - try template.render(Context(dictionary: ["loader": loader]))
  + let environment = Environment(loader: loader)
  + try environment.renderTemplate(name: "index.html")
  ```

- `Loader`s will now throw a `TemplateDoesNotExist` error when a template
  is not found.

- `Namespace` has been removed and replaced by extensions. You can create an
  extension including any custom template tags and filters. A collection of
  extensions can be passed to an `Environment`.

### Enhancements

- `Environment` is a new way to load templates. You can configure an
  environment with custom template filters, tags and loaders and then create a
  template from an environment.

  Environment also provides a convenience method to render a template directly.

- `FileSystemLoader` will now ensure that template paths are within the base
  path. Any template names that try to escape the base path will raise a
  `SuspiciousFileOperation` error.

- New `{% filter %}` tag allowing you to perform a filter across the contents
  of a block.

  ```html+django
  {% filter lowercase %}
    This Text Will Be Lowercased.
  {% endfilter %}
  ```

- You can now use `{{ block.super }}` to render a super block from another `{%
  block %}`.

- `Environment` allows you to provide a custom `Template` subclass, allowing
  new template to use a specific subclass.

- If expressions may now contain filters on variables. For example
  `{% if name|uppercase == "TEST" %}` is now supported.

### Deprecations

- `Template` initialisers have been deprecated in favour of using a template
  loader such as `FileSystemLoader` inside an `Environment`.

- The use of whitespace inside variable filter expression is now deprecated.

  ```diff
  - {{ name | uppercase }}
  + {{ name|uppercase }}
  ```

### Bug Fixes

- Restores compatibility with ARM based platforms such as iOS. Stencil 0.7
  introduced compilation errors due to using the `Float80` type which is not
  available.


## 0.7.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue where using `{% if %}` statements which use operators would
  throw a syntax error.


## 0.7.0

### Breaking

- `TemplateLoader` has been renamed to `FileSystemLoader`. The
  `loadTemplate(s)` methods are now throwing and now take labels for the `name`
  and `names` arguments.

- Many internal classes are no longer public. Some APIs were previously
  accessible due to earlier versions of Swift requiring the types to be public
  to be able to test. Now we have access to `@testable` these can correctly be
  private.

- `{% ifnot %}` tag is now deprecated, please use `{% if not %}` instead.

### Enhancements

- Variable lookup now supports introspection of Swift types. You can now lookup
  values of Swift structures and classes inside a Context.

- If tags can now use prefix and infix operators such as `not`, `and`, `or`,
  `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=`.

    ```html+django
    {% if one or two and not three %}
    ```

- You may now register custom template filters which make use of arguments.
- There is now a `default` filter.

    ```html+django
    Hello {{ name|default:"World" }}
    ```

- There is now a `join` filter.

    ```html+django
    {{ value|join:", " }}
    ```

- `{% for %}` tag now supports filters.

    ```html+django
    {% for user in non_admins|default:admins %}
      {{ user }}
    {% endfor %}
    ```

### Bug Fixes

- Variables (`{{ variable.5 }}`) that reference an array index at an unknown
  index will now resolve to `nil` instead of causing a crash.  
  [#72](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil/issues/72)

- Templates can now extend templates that extend other templates.  
  [#60](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil/issues/60)

- If comparisons will now treat 0 and below numbers as negative.


## 0.6.0

### Enhancements

- Adds support for Swift 3.0.
